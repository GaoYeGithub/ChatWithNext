Run in replit or live server using npm i and then npm run dev

## Productionizing your Next App

To make your next App run smoothly in production make sure to deploy your project with [Repl Deployments](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deployments/about-deployments)!

You can also produce a production build by running `npm run build` and [changing the run command](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl#run) to `npm run start`.
